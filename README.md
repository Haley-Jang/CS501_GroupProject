# Music from brainwave using Machine Learning
#### This is the repository created for the CS501 class group project.

###### For each of files, we haven't specified dependencies yet, so it is required to **manually install the libraries used by the system**.


> To run the system GUI, run musicApp.py.

* Use the 'input' file in the data directory for the brain wave input file.
* You may select channel and speed of the melody to be generated.
* Then press the play button to listen to the reconstructed melody.
